Imagine if there was a BSD-style license that prohibits using source
code to "train" anything "AI" or "large language model". I'd use that.
Since it doesn't exist, no-one is licensed by default to use this.

If you want a license, please ask. Anyone working for my current
employer will receive lenient terms. Anyone wanting an open source
license should ask.

"AI" and large language models require millions of acres of server
farms. These countless servers steal precious crop-water without
producing a crop. The run-off is poisoned. The servers need water
because they run hot. The servers run hot because of their voracious
electricity appetite. New coal plants are built, old coal plants are
re-opened. We burn methane for a crop we cannot eat. The modern pursuit
of Artificial Intelligence hastens the destruction of the planet. At its
present course, humans will go extinct before AI research succeeds.

No permission is given for any use even tangential to "AI" tech. Any use
of this code with "AI" tech nullifies any agreed or presumed license.

Companies like OpenAI develop technology that threatens the human
habitability of Earth. Copyright is not the weapon that will save our
home. I do not expect anyone to license this code. But if a few people
notice? Well, that's enough folk to hum a bar or two of Alice's
Restaurant in three part harmony
